# go-dbc
Deathbycaptcha API written in Go for recaptcha v2

# Installation
`go get -u github.com/Zeroeh/go-dbc`

# Usage
Refer to `example/example.go` for usage and examples.

# Notes
This is only intended for recaptcha v2 tokens, and not for images. I was pressed for time when making this so there is certainly room for improvements.
